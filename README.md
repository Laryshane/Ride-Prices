# Ride-Prices
Do you have an idea for a Ride Share app like Uber? Well this program will help in portion if a Ride Price Calculator Program is needed within the software.

This application of course is used to set Ride Teir options, their prices, miles prices and calculate how much the ride would be for a user.

You can copy this Code into any Python reader that has an interpreter and a console/IDE.

Please feel free to use this as a base and please let me see your results, would love to see it LIVE in an app of a sort!
